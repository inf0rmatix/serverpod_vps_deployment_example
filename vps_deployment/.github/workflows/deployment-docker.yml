# This is a workflow to deploy your Serverpod to a single machine using docker-compose. This is useful for testing and small deployments. For larger deployments, you should use the deployment-aws.yml or deployment-gcp.yml workflows.
# To reduce the workload on the machine we do not use redis in this deployment. If you want to use redis, you need to add it to the docker-compose file and the serverpod configuration.
# You need to setup the correct hostnames in the docker-compose-production file AND the serverpod configuration file.
# Before deploying this workflow, you need to set up the following secrets in your repository settings:
# PAT_GITHUB: A GitHub token with the repo scope
# PAT_USER_GITHUB: GitHub username for the PAT
#
# ## Server setup ##
# on your vps / server you need to generate a keypair and add the public key to the authorized_keys file
## ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
## cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# now copy the private key and add it to the secrets in the github repository
## cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: The private key for the SSH connection which you just 'cat'ed
# SSH_HOST: The host for the SSH connection -> IP or domain
# SSH_USER: The user for the SSH connection -> often root
